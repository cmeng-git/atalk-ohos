Version:        00.10.000 (0010000)
Release Date:   11/18/2025
Author:         cmeng
- Port aTalk to use smack 4.5.0-rc1 release
- Set aTalk minSdkVersion = 26 and sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_11 to be compatible with smack 4.5.0
- Fix JingleFile function call HashManager.getMessageDigest(algorithm) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException: SHA3-256;
  OSGiService makes direct call to smack SecurityUtil.ensureProviderAtFirstPosition(BouncyCastleProvider.class);
  Smack 4.5.0 exclude openpgp in build, causing FileNoFound during smack init. hence 'BC' order is not set.
  See Smack 4.5.0-beta9: JingleFile function call HashManager.getMessageDigest(algorithm) throws NoSuchAlgorithmException: SHA3-256
  https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/smack-4-5-0-beta9-jinglefile-function-call-hashmanager-getmessagedigest-algorithm-throws-nosuchalgorithmexception-sha3-256/96162- Remove XMPP-Bosh patch for reconnection failure on network changed - implemented in smack 4.5.0.
- Change aTalk smack classes to extends XmlElement in place of ExtensionElement where possible.
- Need to add configuration {all*.exclude group: 'xpp3', module: 'xpp3' and 'xpp3_min'} to resolve duplicate class during build.
- Do not crash the aTalk app when creating account over insecure connection; show error message instead.
- Rename IBRCaptchaProcessDialog to IBRProcessDialog; must handle registration for both with/without Captcha Protection;
  Must allow user to click the submit button for IB Register when without captcha protection.
- Proceed to purge local user registration record only if serverAccountDeletion is successful.
- Optimize AccountInfoPresenceActivity implementation to minimize views dynamic settings programmatically.
- Cleanup and update aTalk.doap file.
- Remove 'com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.4.9' dependency; Duration is supported in API-26
- Remove all aTalk source support for < API-26 build support i.e. (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT < Build.VERSION_CODES.O)
- Upgrade libraries org.bouncycastle:xxx-jdk18on:1.79 and org.jitsi:zrtp4j-light:4.1.3 etc
- Remove patch for ejabberd <= 23.01; it sends presence's 'photo' element with no hash value, after user published a new avatar.
- aTalk v4.6.0 is the last version to support OTR. OTR will be removed in all later aTalk releases.

*** Observation with no solution implemented: ***
- Some android devices seem unable to handle properly display info setup (TooManyViews) in AccountInfoPresenceActivity,
  causing ANR in FFR i.e. AccountInfoPresenceActivity$$ExternalSyntheticThrowIAE2.m
  * Do not check isDetailClassEditable() and isDetailClassSupported()
  * Simplify the views dynamic settings programmatically, and fixed them in layout xml;
- aTalk cannot send file to own self using JingleFile Transfer or Legacy Si file transfer.
- Jarjar repackage errors for smack-experimental, smack-extensions and smack-omemo;
  ignored as all the jarjar repackaged files creation are OK. e.g.
  UnsupportedOperationException: NestHost requires ASM7
  UnsupportedOperationException: NestMember requires ASM7

- aTalk uses PlugInManager to add custom code or to remove unimplemented jmf default codecs:
  However PlugInManager.getPlugInList(), the instantiate class will immediately trigger static method that execute
  getPluginInfo(className) hence showing 'Problem loading plugin ...". By design???

- Cleanup for Provisioning implementation classes;
  Only minimum provisioning settings are supported in aTalk, and likely required customization.
- Relocate "Provisioning" preference to root Settings... UI.
- Use EditTextPreference to ensure the preference UI is filled and shown the stored value on open;
  Both preference "android:key" and the stored parameters must use the same name, else store will have extra "android:key" parameter.
- ProvisioningSettings and ProvisioningServiceImpl variables must be in sync for proper saving and retrieval.
- Remove unused classes LazyConfigurationForm,ConfigurationForm, ProvisioningForm, MediaConfigurationService.
- Inproper Base64Encoded password in DB causes crash in CredentialsStorageServiceImpl#movePasswordProperty()

=========================================================================
Version:        00.07.000 (0007000)
Release Date:   05/20/2025
Author:         cmeng
- Show Badge indicator on incoming file request; to ease user identification of the sender in contact list main UI.
- Enable HeadsUp notification for incoming file transfer request to alert user when device is in standby;
  Launch 'App Info...' settings, user must update the File Transfer Notification settings.
  See https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/channels#UpdateChannel.
- Ensure multiple files send/receive for HTTPFileUpload, JingleFileSend and Legacy Bytestream transfer protocols are handled properly; improve UI and process reliability.
- Must re-init all UI button actions whenever the xFileConversationForm is called on UI refresh; as inflateViewForFileTransfer() will change their references.
- Fix ConcurrentModificationException in JingleS5BTransportCandidateImpl#connectToCandidates() checking.
- Change to use TOTAL_CONNECTION_TIMEOUT (10s) for each candidate in establishBytestreamSession checking.
- Do not set file sending/receiving state as History Record while it is still active;
  else any UI refresh will interrupt file transfer, although file transfer may still running in background.
  This happen when send/receive new text or during multiple files receiving.
- Must create file record in DB for proper HTTP file download process update; else the cached info is destroyed when user closes the chat session.
- Use Math.max(COLUMN_TOTAL_SIZE_BYTES, COLUMN_BYTES_DOWNLOADED_SO_FAR) for HttpFileDownloadJabberImpl#queryFileSize();
  later is found to contain file size, and COLUMN_TOTAL_SIZE_BYTES always return 0. Download Manager implementation error?
- Improve and clean up HttpFileDownloadJabberImpl implementation e.g. progress query by Id instead of status.
- Must implement HttpFileDownloadJabberImpl#getTransferredBytes for proper HttpFileDownload progressBar update.
- Implement and support XEP-0066: Out of Band Data sending in Http file transfer in contact or muc chat session.
- Ensure the file transfer UI is shown (post delay 0.5S) before proceed to auto accept file transfer if enabled.
- Fix progressBar indicator not properly updated when the received file size in unknown in HttpFileDownload process.
- Do not constraint the IncomingFileTransferJingleImpl#progress() update with 10mS UPDATE_INTERVAL;
  else final rwBytes may not be reflected in the UI progressBar.
- Ensure all message event ID's in outgoing file transfer are in sync with the file record saved in database for proper status update.
- When file transfer form is first created, it must check that (getXferStatus() == FileTransferStatusChangeEvent.UNKNOWN)
  before start any file send/received process. else file transfer may get repeated in UI.
- Ensure all status definitions in both FileTransferStatusChangeEvent and FileRecord are in sync for correct status tracking.
- Ensure the transport candidates use in file transfer are properly refreshed when the device active network connection is changed.
- Avoid using static mBuilder for both JingleContentDescription and JingleContentTransport; else multiple JingleFileTransfer will interference with each other.
- JingleSessionImpl#jingleSessionListeners cannot be static; otherwise updateSessionState will interfere with each other in multiple files transfer.
- During multiple Jingle files receive, sometimes has the following exception ('session-accept' sent twice):
    JingleIncomingFileOffer.onBytestreamReady() Cannot get InputStream from BytestreamSession:
    java.net.SocketException: Socket is closed java.net.SocketException: Socket is closed
    The problem is due to Recipient send accept twice - problem fixed.
- Legacy file transfer uses the same instance of OperationSetFileTransferJabberImpl to send file with the same NegotiationProgress status callback;
  hence unable to support multiple files transfer. Use difference NegotiationProgress for each OutgoingFileTransferJabberImpl to fix the problem.
- Need to block the unexpected delayed info messages on HttpFileDownload send from server multiple times; else repeated UI requests user to accept file.
- Add serverMsgId and remoteMsgId value to the file history record in the database; to check for unexpected delay info messages send from server.
- Ignore any empty body forward message received during MamQuery process update.
- Fix ChatState notifications not handle properly in MUC chat session.
- Save last send/received message timestamp into mamDate in session record, avoid deleted messages reappear in UI when user relaunch aTalk.
  When last send/received message are purged, then user exit/terminate aTalk. All the purged messages will get retrieved via mamQuery.
  This is because the last message timeStamp is not saved into the session mamDate, and last cached info is destroyed on exit.
- Use OriginIdElement as msgUid if the received message does not contain the msgId.
- Move subclass common CameraCaptureSession.StateCallback into base class CameraStreamBase.
- Replace deprecated option menu setHasOptionsMenu() implementation with MenuProvider.
- Replace deprecated FragmentPagerAdapter with FragmentStateAdapter for the main aTalk MainPagerAdapter.
- Add Arabic language support.

*** Observation with no solution implemented:
- Share from other app works only if aTalk is active (aTalk must be launched and registered on the network);
  Requires aTalk to be registered with network, also onCreateView() is not being called when aTalk is inactive.
- Sometimes JingleFileTransfer request is not received by recipient; and sender abort after 10s timeout; Then the sender fallback to other methods.
  Sometimes aTalk does not receive JingleIncomingFileOffer messages (missing in logcat) after a new build debug. Other Jingle request is ok.
- During multiple files send process, all FileSendConversation UI must be brought/scrolled into view before the file sending is triggered.
- During multiple file send, the 'session-initiate' may not be sent if the sender UI is not in view.
  User has to scroll the UI into view to start. Waiting for UI status to complete the update.
- On file send error, a 'retry' option is offered. However this option is cleared if the user scrolls, and the UI get refresh as History record.

Release Date:   04/01/2024
Author:         cmeng
- Removal of a contact shall purge all its associated history messages, call records and its sessionUuid.
  Otherwise recreate same contact will inherited old sessionUuid and history messages, causing mamQuery problem.
- Improve 'Recent conversations' interface to disable multi-item selection; and allow purge of orphan chat session.
- Add support to delete history messages based on sessionUuid i.e. no associated contact or chatRoom.
- EntityListHelper history record delete will return the actual deleted records count, for display to user.
- Change EntityListHelp to support FragmentActivity caller i.e. onTaskComplete callback to its caller directly.
- ChatPanel#mamQuery must use actual sessionUuid from DB; and it may not be the same as mChatId.

- Fix duplication of chat messages received via delayed delivery in group chat;
  Happen if user rejoins group chat after logout/login; last sent message timestamp not save in configuration
- Fix duplicate display of incoming delayed messages in contact chat session; happen if mam messages are received before delayed messages
- Fix incoming delayed encrypted messages out of timestamp order display. Process times vary for encrypted messages.
  Must sort msgCache before its use.
- If user goes offline after messages sent to an offline buddy; Upon messages received by buddy,
  the receipt status of these messages are not updated in chat UI when user goes online again.
  Move ReceiptReceivedListener implementation out of ChatFragment, and into MessageHistoryServiceImpl with callback.
  This ensure the ReceiptReceivedListener are ready upon user login.
- UserAvatar migrates to use PepEventListener, and ensure proper handling of avatar removal pubsub#event.
  * also avoid retrieve image byte and pass as parameter in function call.
- Update VCardAvatarManager to check and skip repeated request from multiple (x4) user presence's received.
- User new avatar update are published via XEP-0084, and XEP-0153; ejabberd
  responses to the later with vcard-temp and no photo hash, causing aTalk to remove the avatar.
  * Disable VCardAvatarManager process of vcard-temp with no photo hash; use only 'XEP-0084: User Avatar' pubsub#event.
  * Problem reported and fixed by ejabberd: https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/4182
    ejabberd sends presence's, photo element with no hash value, after user publishes a new avatar #4182
- Fix avatar changes received via XEP-0153/XEP-0084 are not updated to the contact/user until user next re-login;
  also user (added as contact entity) avatar does not get updated.
- Merged both UserAvatarListener and VcardAvatarListener into one AvatarChangeListener for more efficient handling of avatar changes.
- ContactJabberImpl introduces new retrieveIfNecessary in getAvatar(boolean) on dynamic request,
  separately it from retrieveOnStart which should be set on user login.
- userCapsNodeNotify() should be handled for each protocolProvider, to support multiple user accounts setup.
- Skip OperationSetPersistentPresenceJabberImpl#publishPresenceStatus(), if user selected the same 'Presence Status'.
- Fix duplicate sending of the initial <presence/> stanza by smack ServiceDiscoveryManager.
- Move ServiceDiscoveryHelper#userCapsNodeNotify() into OperationSetPersistentPresenceJabberImpl,
  tagged to Roster#presenceChanged() callback for process improvement.
- ChatRoomCreateDialog: initAccountSpinner() only after initComboBox(); else onItemSelected() will trigger
  initComboBox() and second network access duplication;
- Remove main menu 'Sign out' and 'Exit' options to prevent user unintentionally unregister himself from server;
  e.g. unable to receive incoming call.
- SmackConfiguration.setDefaultReplyTimeout to 10000 ms.

Release Date:   02/29/2024
Author:         cmeng
- AndroidOmemoService initOmemoDevice() setReplyTimeout not working and always failed with NoResponseException;
  * Implement setReplyTimeout for both Async.go in smack OmemoManager/OmemoService, else set value is reset by aTalk other stanza processes.
  * set in OmemoService for initializeAsync(), and within the PepEventListener<OmemoDeviceListElement>
  See https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/smack-4-4-7-xmppconnection-setreplytimeout-value-is-not-guaranteed-when-the-stanza-is-sent-asynchronously/93636
- Smack OmemoManager handle of Pubsub#event in PepEventListener has NoResponseException; end in endless loop when server
  send multiple (x15) Pubsub#event's, and eventually eventually crashes smack with InvalidXmlException.
  setReplyTimeout to 15s and block all new Pubsub#Event once it is served, check via publishedDeviceList.
- Finally aTalk decided to make local changes, replacing the 2 files in smack-omemo library i.e.
  * OmemoManager.java and OmemoService.java classes
- Add support for XEP-0191: Blocking Command to block communications with a specific contact and domain.
- Implement EntityCapsPersistentCache using mySQlite DB instead of file system for speed.
- Fix erased contact/chatroom history messages reappear after return to chatSession;
  messages are retrieved from unclear chatPanel@msgCache.
- Disable 'Contact Info' option when user is offline; Contact Info is not properly initialized when user is offline.
- Must initPreferences() for all views before setPreferencesFromResource(); else any updated values in shared_prefs
  will not be reflected in preference UI: IceFragment, TelephonyFragment and XmppConnectionFragment
- Allow user removal of a DomainJid from the contact list UI.
- Allow user moving of contact not in the Roster; ServerStoredContactListJabberImpl#moveContact()
- Include check contact blocking state in MetaContactRender#isShowCallBtn() and isShowVideoCallBtn()
- Fix Telephony UI Cancel button not working: must set TelephonyFragment.TELEPHONY_TAG in fragment Tag on launch.
- Set android:exported to true for all activities launch via preference <intent android:action/>; else aTalk crashes in API-34.
- Add/Remove of ContactPresenceStatusListener and ContactBlockingStatusListener should be for each registered ProtocolProvider
  * MetaContactListAdapter#addContactStatusListener etc
- Clean up ShareActivity source - remove the unnecessary FragmentPagerAdapter implementation.
- Create common CustomDialogCb with checkBox option for: AccountDelete, ChatMessageDelete, and ContactBlock
- Use full class path for all references to avoid problem.
- JingleFile transfer AbstractMethodError resolved with aTalk source patches; Google team is unable to offer any solution in gradle release built.
  * Must place two smack files into aTalk local source, and defined QNAME in file
  * a. org.jivesoftware.smackx.jingle.transports.jingle_s5b.elements.JingleS5BTransportInfo
  * b. org.jivesoftware.smackx.jingle_filetransfer.element.JingleFileTransferChild
- Fix call notification control ui partial cropping of buttons.
- Clean up ChatSessionManager class source removing unused methods.
- Alert dialog drawable/background_alert_dialog must use ?attr/colorBackground, to align with text font theme color.
- Drop dependency and replace com.code-troopers.betterpickers with android DatePicker-spinner mode (API-24).
- Improve call history deletion UI for all call records prior to user set date.
- Improve account preference birth date setting UI.
- Remove MapsInitializer.initialize(), no further required; default to use Renderer.LATEST
  see https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/renderer#opt-out
- Remove all old classes supporting <API-24: AbstractFunction, Consumer, Function, Predicate, and Supplier

- JingleFile transfer AbstractMethodError remained; disabled for aTalk release. Awaiting Google team solution feedback

- Drop com.jakewharton:butterknife-compiler:10.2.3 dependency and remove jdk-15 max restriction;
  use android View binding class instead.
- Change file transfer protocol priority to:
  * The file transport is selected with the following priority order if contact is online:
  * a. httpFileUpload (for OMEMO and plain chat session: chatType)
  * b. jingleFileSend (Secure JET or Plain) (NAT not supported)
  * c. Legacy byteStream transfer protocol for SOCK5 with fallback on IBB on user retry
- Fix Smack 4.4.7: ByteStream Sock5 implementation does not take care of the host address with zone id
- Enable webView cache mode
- JingleFile transfer AbstractMethodError remained; disabled for aTalk release. Awaiting Google team solution feedback
- API-34 overrides aTalk message Snooze pending intent; actual implementation depends on manufacturers i.e.
  auto enable after 3 notifications (pixel) or show user snooze option (Notes 10) with timer etc.

- Update gradle build environment to with gradle 8.0.0 and above:
  a. Use Android Studio Hedgehog | 2023.1.1 Patch
  b. distributionUrl=https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip
  c. classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.2.2'

     android.nonFinalResIds=false
     # Gradle >=8.0.0: Allow transitive resource identifiers use in aTalk.
     android.nonTransitiveRClass=false

- Fix ContextCompat.registerReceiver flag setting: If this receiver is listening for broadcasts sent from the system
  or from other apps—even other apps that you own—use the RECEIVER_EXPORTED flag. If instead this receiver is listening
  only for broadcasts sent by your app, use the RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED flag; and broadcaster must setPackage(getPackageName()).
  * Use RECEIVER_EXPORTED for HttpFileDownloadJabberImpl(), UpdateServiceImpl(), and ConnectivityManagerListenerImpl()
  * Use RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED and required to setPackage(getPackageName()) in sendBroadcast for:
  a. Fix option Exit not working in android API-34
  b. Fix CallControl Notification with proper callback.
  c. Fix message received popup with proper callback.
