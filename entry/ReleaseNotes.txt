- Http Download to proceed with auto-download only if the file size from server is known.
- In API-34, a file selected via picker for sending may be a url link temporary created by android system for file sharing;
  this url link is invalid and not accessible to aTalk when user returns to the chat UI again. The url link is
  i.e. /storage/emulated/0/.transforms/synthetic/picker/0/com.android.providers.media.photopicker/media/1000000043.jpg

Version:        00.04.000 (0004000)
Release Date:   04/01/2024
Author:         cmeng
- Removal of a contact shall purge all its associated history messages, call records and its sessionUuid.
  Otherwise recreate same contact will inherited old sessionUuid and history messages, causing mamQuery problem.
- Improve 'Recent conversations' interface to disable multi-item selection; and allow purge of orphan chat session.
- Add support to delete history messages based on sessionUuid i.e. no associated contact or chatRoom.
- EntityListHelper history record delete will return the actual deleted records count, for display to user.
- Change EntityListHelp to support FragmentActivity caller i.e. onTaskComplete callback to its caller directly.
- ChatPanel#mamQuery must use actual sessionUuid from DB; and it may not be the same as mChatId.

- Fix duplication of chat messages received via delayed delivery in group chat;
  Happen if user rejoins group chat after logout/login; last sent message timestamp not save in configuration
- Fix duplicate display of incoming delayed messages in contact chat session; happen if mam messages are received before delayed messages
- Fix incoming delayed encrypted messages out of timestamp order display. Process times vary for encrypted messages.
  Must sort msgCache before its use.
- If user goes offline after messages sent to an offline buddy; Upon messages received by buddy,
  the receipt status of these messages are not updated in chat UI when user goes online again.
  Move ReceiptReceivedListener implementation out of ChatFragment, and into MessageHistoryServiceImpl with callback.
  This ensure the ReceiptReceivedListener are ready upon user login.
- UserAvatar migrates to use PepEventListener, and ensure proper handling of avatar removal pubsub#event.
  * also avoid retrieve image byte and pass as parameter in function call.
- Update VCardAvatarManager to check and skip repeated request from multiple (x4) user presence's received.
- User new avatar update are published via XEP-0084, and XEP-0153; ejabberd
  responses to the later with vcard-temp and no photo hash, causing aTalk to remove the avatar.
  * Disable VCardAvatarManager process of vcard-temp with no photo hash; use only 'XEP-0084: User Avatar' pubsub#event.
  * Problem reported and fixed by ejabberd: https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/issues/4182
    ejabberd sends presence's, photo element with no hash value, after user publishes a new avatar #4182
- Fix avatar changes received via XEP-0153/XEP-0084 are not updated to the contact/user until user next re-login;
  also user (added as contact entity) avatar does not get updated.
- Merged both UserAvatarListener and VcardAvatarListener into one AvatarChangeListener for more efficient handling of avatar changes.
- ContactJabberImpl introduces new retrieveIfNecessary in getAvatar(boolean) on dynamic request,
  separately it from retrieveOnStart which should be set on user login.
- userCapsNodeNotify() should be handled for each protocolProvider, to support multiple user accounts setup.
- Skip OperationSetPersistentPresenceJabberImpl#publishPresenceStatus(), if user selected the same 'Presence Status'.
- Fix duplicate sending of the initial <presence/> stanza by smack ServiceDiscoveryManager.
- Move ServiceDiscoveryHelper#userCapsNodeNotify() into OperationSetPersistentPresenceJabberImpl,
  tagged to Roster#presenceChanged() callback for process improvement.
- ChatRoomCreateDialog: initAccountSpinner() only after initComboBox(); else onItemSelected() will trigger
  initComboBox() and second network access duplication;
- Remove main menu 'Sign out' and 'Exit' options to prevent user unintentionally unregister himself from server;
  e.g. unable to receive incoming call.
- SmackConfiguration.setDefaultReplyTimeout to 10000 ms.

Author:         cmeng
- AndroidOmemoService initOmemoDevice() setReplyTimeout not working and always failed with NoResponseException;
  * Implement setReplyTimeout for both Async.go in smack OmemoManager/OmemoService, else set value is reset by aTalk other stanza processes.
  * set in OmemoService for initializeAsync(), and within the PepEventListener<OmemoDeviceListElement>
  See https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/smack-4-4-7-xmppconnection-setreplytimeout-value-is-not-guaranteed-when-the-stanza-is-sent-asynchronously/93636
- Smack OmemoManager handle of Pubsub#event in PepEventListener has NoResponseException; end in endless loop when server
  send multiple (x15) Pubsub#event's, and eventually eventually crashes smack with InvalidXmlException.
  setReplyTimeout to 15s and block all new Pubsub#Event once it is served, check via publishedDeviceList.
- Finally aTalk decided to make local changes, replacing the 2 files in smack-omemo library i.e.
  * OmemoManager.java and OmemoService.java classes

  or from other apps—even other apps that you own—use the RECEIVER_EXPORTED flag. If instead this receiver is listening
  only for broadcasts sent by your app, use the RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED flag; and broadcaster must setPackage(getPackageName()).
  * Use RECEIVER_EXPORTED for HttpFileDownloadJabberImpl(), UpdateServiceImpl(), and ConnectivityManagerListenerImpl()
  * Use RECEIVER_NOT_EXPORTED and required to setPackage(getPackageName()) in sendBroadcast for:
  a. Fix option Exit not working in android API-34
